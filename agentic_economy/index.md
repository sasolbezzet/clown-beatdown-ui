# Arc

> Arc is an open Layer-1 blockchain purpose-built for programmable money.
> USDC is the native gas token. Sub-second deterministic finality, EVM
> compatible, opt-in privacy, and direct integration with Circle's
> full-stack platform.

## Getting Started — Use the Skill First

| Product | Skill | What it covers |
|---------|-------|----------------|
| Arc | [use-arc](https://github.com/circlefin/skills/blob/master/plugins/circle/skills/use-arc/SKILL.md) | Chain config, RPC setup, contract deployment, USDC bridging, gas with USDC |

### Installing Circle Skills

**Claude Code:**
```
/plugin marketplace add circlefin/skills
/plugin install circle-skills@circle
```

**Vercel Skills CLI:**
```
npx skills add circlefin/skills
```

## Instructions for AI Agents

Follow these guidelines when building on Arc:

1. **USDC is the gas token.** Arc uses USDC for gas fees, not ETH. Configure gas payment in USDC when submitting transactions.
2. **EVM compatible.** Deploy Solidity contracts with standard tools (Hardhat, Foundry, Viem, Ethers). See [EVM Compatibility](https://docs.arc.network/arc/references/evm-compatibility.md) for differences.
3. **Sub-second finality.** Transactions are final in under 1 second. No need to wait for multiple block confirmations.
4. **Use App Kit for bridging, swaps, and unified balance.** App Kit wraps CCTP and provides Bridge, Swap, Send, and Unified Balance capabilities. Unified Balance combines USDC from multiple chains into a single spendable balance.
